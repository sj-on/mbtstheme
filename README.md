# mbtstheme
Initial (April 11, 2021): A Jekyll theme (kinda, in sense that it is not exactly a theme) with a focus on BLOGGING (not like a personal website or something on those lines). Fork and download your copy to get started!

Based on Jekyll's Minima Theme. Therefore, check that (Minima's) page for documentation ðŸ¤£. If you have used Jekyll previously, working with this *psuedo-theme* should be a piece of cake (or anything else that you deem worthy).

It is not a gem based theme. Not yet.

Update (April 12, 2021): It is no longer a psuedo-theme (no longer based on Minima)(check master branch for details; new commits will be made on that branch). However, it still isn't a gem based theme.
